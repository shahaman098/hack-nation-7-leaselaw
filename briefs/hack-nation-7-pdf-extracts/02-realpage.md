Goals and Motivation

Rental Housing Law Navigator is an AI system that reads public housing law and answers one question for any apartment
address: which rules apply here today, and what is about to change?
 THE QUESTION                     How might AI turn thousands of pages of state and local housing law into accurate, cited,
                                  address-level answers that renters, advocates, housing agencies and housing providers can
                                  trust?

The problem is specific, real and getting harder
Rental housing in the U.S. is regulated in layers: state statutes, county rules and city ordinances, each with its own coverage
tests (building age, unit count, owner type), effective dates and exemptions. The answer to “what rules apply to this apartment?”
depends on the exact address, and it changes often.


 14                                             Jan 2026                                       Jun 2026
 cities and counties across 8 states have       California’s amended antitrust law on          Massachusetts’ high court removed a
 enacted local bans on algorithmic rent-        common pricing algorithms (AB 325 / SB         statewide rent-control question from the
 setting since late 2024, most with             763) took effect, adding a state layer on      November ballot. Proposed changes
 different definitions and penalties.           top of the local ones.                         don’t always become law, and tools must
                                                                                               know the difference.



Today, getting a reliable answer means reading municipal codes, statutes and pending bills by hand. Renters don’t know their
rights, small housing providers don’t know their obligations, and advocates and agencies can’t see the full picture across
jurisdictions. The source text is public, but it is unstructured, scattered and constantly changing.


Who This Helps

 RENTERS                            Know their rights at their own address: rent increase limits, deposit caps, fee rules, eviction
                                    protections.
 ADVOCATES &                        See which protections cover which buildings, and what a pending bill would change.
 AGENCIES
 HOUSING PROVIDERS                  Especially small owners without legal teams: understand their obligations before they act.


 THE CHALLENGE IN ONE               In 24 hours, build a working system that extracts rules from a provided corpus of real
 LINE                               housing law, resolves any sample address to the rules that apply to it with citations, and
                                    shows which addresses a law change affects.


What Teams Build – Use the provided data & codebase

From legal text to an address-level answer
Three required modules plus stretch goals, built on a starter pack we provide so teams spend the 24 hours on AI, not data
collection. Minimum entry and event rules are under Rules, Submission and Scoring. Click here to download the data &
code.

 1. Extract                   2. Resolve                  3. Apply                    4. Explain                  5. Track change
 Turn statutes and            Geocode an address          Test each rule’s            Return every                Given a new or
 ordinances into              and build its               coverage conditions         applicable rule with a      pending law, list the
 structured rule records,     jurisdiction stack:         against building facts:     plain-language              addresses affected
 using the provided           state, county, city.        year built, units, owner    summary and a               and what changes for
 schema.                                                  type.                       citation to the source      each.
                                                                                      text.



 Module A: Rule extraction          An agent reads each document in the corpus and outputs one record per rule, in the provided
 Required                           JSON format. Extraction must be automated, not hand-coded: category, jurisdiction, requirement,
                                    coverage conditions, exemptions, effective date, status (enacted or pending), penalty, source
                                    citation and quoted span.
 Module B: Address lookup           Given an address, return the jurisdiction stack and every applicable rule. Where a local rule
 Required                           overrides a state rule, the system must say so. Where coverage depends on a fact the data does
                                    not contain, it must say “unknown”, not guess.
 Module C: Change tracking          Run the provided change test cases. For each one, list affected sample addresses and the
 Required                           before/after rule set, and support an “as of date” query.

Scope for 24 Hours

3 states · 10 cities · 6 rule categories
Small enough to finish, varied enough to be hard. The jurisdictions were chosen to cover state-only rules, layered local rules,
and recent or failed changes.

Test Cases and Starter Pack

Real law changes, packaged data
Change tracking is tested on real 2025–2027 changes, real pending bills and one fictional ordinance revealed mid-event. To
make 24 hours realistic, Realpage pre-packages a starter kit from public sources, so teams don’t lose the first day to scraping
and cleanup. Everything is in one Google Drive folder which you can access here.

Change-tracking test cases
 Test case                                           What a correct system does
 T1 · CA AB 325 / SB 763, effective 1/1/2026         “Not yet effective” for CA addresses as of 12/31/2025; “applies” as of 1/2/2026
 T2 · Hoboken and Jersey City local bans             Each ban only inside its own city limits; neither in Newark
 T3 · NJ FAIR Act, signed 7/20/2026, effective       “Not yet effective” today, “applies” on 7/2/2027; flags a possible conflict with the two local
 7/1/2027                                            bans
 T4 · MA S.2983 and H.5222 (pending bills)           Reports them as pending, never in force; lists the addresses they would affect
 T5 · MA rent-control ballot question, struck        Reports no rent cap for Boston or Cambridge; affected set is empty
 6/23/2026
 T6 · Fictional Cambridge ordinance                  Extracts it unaided, lists affected addresses, and gets its future effective date right
 (released at hour 16)

Responsible AI by Design

Build for transparency, not legal verdicts
The system should make the law easier to see and understand, without pretending to be a lawyer or helping anyone work
around the rules.

  THE SOLUTION SHOULD                                                    THE SOLUTION MUST NOT
  • Cite the source text and retrieval date for every rule it            • Present output as legal advice or a compliance
    reports.                                                               certification.
  • Show an “as of” date on every answer and separate                    • Suggest ways to avoid, structure around or evade a rule.

  • Say “unknown” when coverage depends on facts it                      • Use customer, resident, pricing or other non-public data.

  • Flag conflicts and low-confidence answers for human
    review.
  • Explain rules in plain language that a renter can act on.
  • Keep an auditable log of sources, model outputs and
    changes.

From Hackathon to Impact

The strongest teams may be considered for follow-on prototyping, talent conversations, and a potential open public-good
release of the rule dataset with Realpage and housing partners.
 THE INTENDED                       Show that responsible AI can make housing law visible at the level that matters, a single
 OUTCOME                            address, so renters know their rights, providers know their obligations, and everyone can
                                    see what is changing, with every answer traceable to the source.


Rules, Submission and Scoring

How the event works
The participant guide in the starter pack has the full detail. These are the rules every team needs on day one.

  RULES OF THE EVENT                                                     WHAT TEAMS SUBMIT
  • Minimum viable entry: Modules A and B, scored on the                 • rules.json: rule records in the provided format, with
    dev set.                                                               citation and quoted source text
  • Automated extraction only. The hour-16 ordinance                     • lookups.json: for all 500 addresses, each rule’s result:
    and a live rerun in the demo check this.                               applies, unknown, superseded, not yet effective, or
  • “Unknown” is a valid answer when coverage depends                      pending
    on facts not in the data, and it earns credit.                       • changes.json: affected addresses (and conflict flags)
  • No non-public data; no scraping against a site’s terms.                for each test
  • Every interface says “not legal advice.”                             • Three short videos which need to include your scores
